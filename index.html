You have to take offline courses like CEH(Certified Ethical Hacking) or OSCP(Offensive Security Certified Professionals) ,GIAC Pentester and so on.
    </h3>
    <h2>Basic</h2>
    <h3>Before going to the actual one you need to start with basics .</h3>
    <h3><ul><li>Coding:Practice the coding and master atleast 1 language or more. For the beginners new to the digital world, start with HTML then css then javascript then python.
